cd StableCoin-Defi-Protocol
forge build
```

### Usage
- #### For local Deployment

1.  Start a local node
```make anvil```

- #### For testnet deployment

1. Setup environment variables
You'll want to set your SEPOLIA_RPC_URL and PRIVATE_KEY as environment variables. You can add them to a .env file.

- PRIVATE_KEY: The private key of your account (like from metamask) which has testnet ETH.
